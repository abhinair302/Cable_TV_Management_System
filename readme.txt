Hi, I'm Abhijeet R Nair. I‚Äôd like to share a few points about this project:

This was my first programming project, developed as part of my Class 12 Informatics Practices coursework. At the time, I was just beginning to explore programming, so the structure and coding practices may not be perfect. Concepts like functions, modular design, and clean architecture were quite new to me then ‚Äî so please bear with any formatting or logic inconsistencies you might notice.
